It seems like you're encountering an error while rendering a PDF using XeLaTeX. The error message "Missing \endcsname inserted" typically indicates a problem with LaTeX code, possibly caused by a typo or an incorrect command.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check LaTeX Code:
Review the LaTeX code in your document, particularly around line 31 where the error occurred. Look for any missing or misused commands, unclosed environments, or incorrect syntax.
Check for Special Characters:
Make sure that there are no special characters or symbols that LaTeX might interpret incorrectly. For example, check for unescaped characters like #, %, $, {, }, and so on.
Check Packages and Definitions:
If your document includes custom packages or definitions, ensure that they are correctly defined and used. Sometimes conflicts or errors in custom commands can lead to compilation issues.
Check Included Files:
If your document includes external files or figures, ensure that they are correctly referenced and that their contents are valid LaTeX code.
Compile in Stages:
Try to isolate the problematic part of your document by commenting out sections and compiling in stages. This can help pinpoint where the error is occurring.
Check Log File:
The "paper.log" file mentioned in the error message should provide more detailed information about what caused the compilation error. Look for clues or error messages in the log file to help diagnose the issue.
Update Packages:
Ensure that your LaTeX distribution and packages are up to date. Sometimes, outdated packages can cause compatibility issues and errors.
Consult LaTeX Forums or Communities:
If you're still unable to resolve the issue, consider posting your LaTeX code or error message on LaTeX forums or communities like Stack Exchange's TeX - LaTeX forum. Other users may be able to provide specific guidance based on the details of your document.
By following these steps and carefully reviewing your LaTeX code and error messages, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the compilation error.

The error message "Missing \endcsname inserted" in LaTeX often indicates a problem with how a command or macro is being used, particularly related to control sequences and protected commands.

Here's what you can do to troubleshoot and potentially fix this issue:

Check Line 31 in Your LaTeX Document:
Go to line 31 in your LaTeX document and examine the code around that line, especially the command that caused the error. Look for any issues such as a missing or misplaced backslash (\), incorrect usage of a command or macro, or an unclosed environment.
Look for \protect Usage:
The error message mentions \protect, which is often used to protect fragile commands in LaTeX. Check if you are using \protect correctly, especially in contexts where it's needed to prevent expansion issues.
Check for Special Characters:
Make sure that there are no special characters or symbols that LaTeX might interpret incorrectly. Check for unescaped characters like #, %, $, {, }, and so on, especially within commands or macros.
Review Tables or Cross-References:
The error message refers to "table.2" which suggests that there might be an issue with a table or a cross-reference related to a table. Check if you are referencing tables correctly and if the table environment is properly closed.
Compile in Stages:
Comment out portions of your document and compile in stages to isolate the problematic part. This can help you identify the specific line or command causing the error.
Check Log File for Details:
The "paper.log" file mentioned in the error message should contain more detailed information about what caused the compilation error. Look for clues or error messages in the log file to understand the context of the error.
Consult LaTeX Resources:
If you're still unable to resolve the issue, consider consulting LaTeX resources such as forums, documentation, or asking for help from LaTeX experts. They may be able to provide insights or solutions based on the specific details of your document.
By carefully reviewing your LaTeX code and error messages, focusing on the mentioned areas, and following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the "Missing \endcsname inserted" error during compilation.

The error message "Missing \endcsname inserted" in LaTeX usually indicates a problem with how LaTeX is parsing or interpreting a command or macro. It often occurs when there's an issue with command names, especially when they contain special characters or when using certain LaTeX constructs incorrectly.

Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially fix this error:

Check Line 31 in Your LaTeX Document:
Go to line 31 in your LaTeX document and review the code around that line, focusing on the command mentioned in the error message. Look for any issues such as missing or misplaced backslashes (\), incorrect usage of commands, or incorrect syntax.
Review Command Definitions:
If the error involves a custom command or macro, ensure that it is defined correctly earlier in your document. Check for any inconsistencies or mistakes in the definition that could lead to this error.
Check for Special Characters:
Look for special characters or symbols within commands or macros, especially those that could be causing issues with parsing. Make sure that special characters are properly escaped or handled according to LaTeX syntax rules.
Examine Cross-References or Labels:
Since the error message mentions "table.2," check if you are referencing tables or labels correctly in your document. Ensure that all labels are defined and that references are correctly formatted.
Compile in Stages:
Try commenting out portions of your document and compiling in stages to isolate the problematic part. This can help identify the specific line or command causing the error.
Check Log File for Details:
The "paper.log" file mentioned in the error message should provide more information about the context of the error and possibly additional clues on what caused it. Look for specific error messages or warnings related to the problematic line.
Consult LaTeX Resources:
If you're still unable to resolve the issue, consider seeking help from LaTeX forums, communities, or experts. They may be able to provide insights or solutions based on the details of your document and the error message.
By carefully reviewing your LaTeX code, focusing on the mentioned areas, and following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify and address the issue causing the "Missing \endcsname inserted" error during compilation.
